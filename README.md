IoT lamp for Innovation school.

There are three versions.
- The initial version uses an ESP8266, relay module and 230V AC filament lamp. Some details can be found in /documentation directory.

- A modified version of the initial version uses ESP8266 and a RGB LED ring of WS2812 LED's. It eliminates the relay module and the potentially hazardous 230V wiring. CAD design is similar to old version.

- The new version uses ESP32 and a RGB LED ring of WS2812B LEDs. CAD design is modified based on a hexagonal cylinder and ping pong balls for effects.

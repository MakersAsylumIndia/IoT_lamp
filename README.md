Mood lamp for Innovation school.

There are three versions.
- The initial version uses an ESP8266, relay module and 230V AC filament lamp. Some details can be found in </documentation> directory.

- A modified version of the initial version uses ESP8266 and a RGB LED ring of WS2812 LED's. It eliminates the relay module and the potentially hazardous 230V wiring. CAD design is similar to old version.

- There are two new versions - one based on the ESP32 and another based on an Arduino Nano. Both versions use a LED ring of sixteen WS2812B RGB LEDs (neopixels). Assembly consists of only laser cut part	s without any additional mounting hardware such as screws.

- Earlier prototypes consisted of a hexagon design with outer shell using living hinges, an octagon design using a pair of interlocking cubes and four iterations of the latest version.
